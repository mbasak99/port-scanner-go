# Background
I've wanted to properly learn about networking and how things work when you make requests and call endpoints and stuff like that. So this is my excuse to learn two things I've been wanting to understand, Go and Networking, and combine them into one. This project aims to expand my understanding of what ports are, how a device (my PC in this instance) uses its ports to communicate with the external world, and the security implications of ports.

# Current Level
I know TCP is used for network calls in REST APIs. HTTP is 80 and HTTPS is 443. No real knowledge or understanding beyond that as of now.

# Reflection Post Project
TODO!

# Steps to run this project
`go run src/main.go`
